1. Before Use

  This sample program has been written for and tested upon the CPU board 
  RSK+RZA1H YR0K77210C000BE.  

  ****************************** CAUTION ******************************
   This sample program is for reference only. Please use this sample 
   program for technical reference.
  ****************************** CAUTION ******************************

  Do not compiler this sample with the size optimsation setting -Os 
  use -O3 instead. 

2. System Requirements

  The system requirements for this sample program are listed below.

    CPU                      : RZ/A1H
    Evaluation board         : YR0K77210C000BE (CPU board)
    Toolchain                : GNU 4.9-GNUARM-NONE_v14.02
    Development environment  : Renesas e2studio
                               Version 3.1
                                          
3. Operation Confirmation Conditions
  
  (1) Operating frequency
      The RZ/A1H clock pulse oscillator is set to see that the RZ/A1H clocks 
      on the CPU board YR0K77210C000BE have the following frequencies. 
      (The frequencies indicate the values in the state that the clock with 
      13.33MHz is input to the EXTAL pin in RZ/A1H clock mode 0.)
      - Maximum operating frequency     : 400MHz
      - Image processing clock          : 266.67MHz
      - Internal bus clock              : 133.33MHz
      - Peripheral clock1               : 66.67MHz
      - Peripheral clock0               : 33.33MHz

  (2) Linker file configuration
      GNU_e2studio-QSPI_SpSb.ld - Boot program loaded into QSPI memory. 
            
  (3) Setting for cache  
      Initial setting for L1 cache is executed by MMU. 
      This sample program does not provide L2 cache setting.

  (4) Operational Procedure

  Use the following procedure to execute this sample program.

  (5)   Setting for DIP switches and jumpers
        Set the  DIP switches and jumpers of the YR0K77210C000BE as follows.

        SW4   - SW4-1 OFF, SW4-2 OFF, SW4-3 OFF, SW4-4 OFF, 
                SW4-5 OFF, SW4-6 OFF, SW4-7 OFF, SW4-8 OFF
        SW6   - SW6-1 OFF, SW6-2 ON, SW6-3 OFF, SW6-4 ON, SW6-5 ON, SW6-6 ON
        
        All Jumpers shall not be fitted with the following exceptions
           JP11 1-2 connected
           JP12 1-2 connected
           JP21 1-2 connected
           JP18 1-2 connected
           
  ****************************** CAUTION ******************************
        Ensure the PWR_SEL jumper is set correctly, when set to 2-3 
        the application of more than 5V will destroy the devices on 
        the board.
        PWR_SEL 2-3 connected (5V)
		This sample assumes all parts on the RSK+RZA1H board are at 
		their default states as shown on the schematics diagram.
  ****************************** CAUTION ******************************
     
  (7) Setting up the sample program
      Copy the [RZ_A1H_QSPI_LOADER] directory into the e2studio work space
      directory of the host PC.

  (8) Activating integrated development environment
      Start integrated development environment e2studio.
      Import the sample project into a workspace as described in the tutorial
      manual.

  (8) Building [RZ_A1H_QSPI_LOADER] project
      This is the boot loader project to be programmed into the QSPI 
      device (IC26) on the RSK+RZA1H. 
      After importing [RZ_A1H_QSPI_LOADER] project, select the Release
      build configuration from the menu bar: 
		Project > Build Configurations > Set Active > Release
	  Build this configuration to generate the 
      binary file RZ_A1H_QSPI_LOADER.bin.

  (9) Loading the boot loader program into the QSPI device
      Run the batch file batch file (Program_QSPI_Loader.bat) which calls 
      the JLink executable, instructing it to load the binary file (RZ_A1H_QSPI_LOADER.bin) 
      found in the Release folder. This instruction is specified in the 
	  Program_QSPI_Loader.command file.
